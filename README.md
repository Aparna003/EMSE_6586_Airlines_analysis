The objective of this project is to transform a flattened JSON dataset containing information about airline statistics into a format suitable for loading into a SQL database. This dataset contains detailed statistics related to airlines, including flight delays, cancellations, diversions, and on-time performance, organized by airport codes, months, and years. By delving into flight performance metrics such as delays, cancellations, and on-time performance, airlines can identify trends and patterns to streamline operations and minimize disruptions.
